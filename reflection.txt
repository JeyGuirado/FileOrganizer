1. Duplicate was the hardest to implement while unlink was the easiest

2. I was not able to test because I was not able to get it to run. I need to come to office hours and be more present in class so 
I can complete these PAs, and do them on a more timely basis

3. I learned that interacting with files using system calls felt similar to Java, and that I need a buffer to read and write
data from files in chunks.
